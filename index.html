						Extensions are small software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to adopt browser functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

				<h4>Creating extensions width <b> Web Extensions </b></h4>
				<img data-src="images/WebExtension.png" alt="web extensions">
				<aside class="notes">WebExtensions are a way to write browser extensions: that is, programs installed inside a web browser that modify the behaviour of the browser or of web pages loaded by the browser. 
					They are built on a set of cross-browser APIs, so WebExtensions written for Google Chrome or Opera will in most cases run in Firefox or Edge too.

				<h4>Anatomy of an extension</h4>
				<img alt="Anatomy of an extension" style="height: 100%;width: 46%;display: block;margin: 0 auto" src="images/manifest.png" data-lazy-loaded="">
				<aside class="notes">
						An extension consists of a collection of files, packaged for distribution and installation. 
						In this article, we will quickly go through the files that might be present in an extension.	

						This is the only file that must be present in every extension. It contains basic metadata such as its name, version and the permissions it requires. It also provides pointers to other files in the extension.
						This manifest can also contain pointers to several other types of files:
								• Background scripts: Implement long-running logic.
								• Icons for the extension and any buttons it might define.
								• Sidebars, popups, and options pages: HTML documents that provide content for various user interface components.
								• Content scripts: JavaScript included with your extension, that you will inject into web pages.
								• Web-accessible resources: Make packaged content accessible to web pages and content scripts.
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section>
					<h4>Background scripts</h4>
					<aside class="notes">Extensions often need to maintain long-term state or perform long-term operations independently of the lifetime of any particular web page or browser window. 
						     That is what background scripts are for.
								Background scripts are loaded as soon as the extension is loaded and stay loaded until the extension is disabled or uninstalled. 
								You can use any of the WebExtension APIs in the script, as long as you have requested the necessary permissions.</aside>
				</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Sidebars, popups, options pages</h4>
				<aside class="notes">Your extension can include various user interface components whose content is defined using an HTML document:
						• a sidebar is a pane that is displayed at the left-hand side of the browser window, next to the web page
						• a popup is a dialog that you can display when the user clicks on a toolbar button or address bar button
						• an options page is a page that's shown when the user accesses your add-on's preferences in the browser's native add-ons manager.
				For each of these components, you create an HTML file and point to it using a specific property in manifest.json. The HTML file can include CSS and JavaScript files, just like a normal web page.</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Extension pages</h4>
				<aside class="notes">You can also include HTML documents in your extension which are not attached to some predefined user interface component. Unlike the documents you might provide for sidebars, popups, or options pages, these don't have an entry in manifest.json. 
					However, they do also get access to all the same privileged WebExtension APIs as your background script.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Content scripts	</h4>		
					<aside class="notes">Use content scripts to access and manipulate web pages. Content scripts are loaded into web pages and run in the context of that particular page.
						Content scripts are extension-provided scripts which run in the context of a web page; this differs from scripts which are loaded by the page itself, including those which are provided in 'script' elements within the page.
						Content scripts can see and manipulate the page's DOM, just like normal scripts loaded by the page.
						Unlike normal page scripts, they can:
								• Make cross-domain XHR requests.
								• Use a small subset of the WebExtension APIs.
								• Exchange messages with their background scripts and can in this way indirectly access all the WebExtension APIs.
						Content scripts cannot directly access normal page scripts but can exchange messages with them using the standard `window.postMessage() API.
						Usually, when we talk about content scripts, we are referring to JavaScript, but you can inject CSS into web pages using the same mechanism.
						</aside>

				<section>
					<h4>Web accessible resources</h4>
					<aside class="notes">Web accessible resources are resources such as images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you include in the extension and want to make accessible to content scripts and page scripts. 
							For example, if a content script wants to insert some images into web pages, you could include them in the extension and make them web accessible. Then the content script could create and append img tags which reference the images via the src attribute.</aside>
